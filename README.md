# DataAnalysis_UFCfemalefighters

## Goal
1. To study the basic fighting metrics for all female UFC fighters and create an interactive dashboard to present them. 
2. To explore trends in UFC female fight statistics, learn about which fighters are the best based on historical data from 2013-02-23 to 2021-03-20.


## Work flow
### Data extraction
There were two datasets on Kaggle that are used in this project. One has a list of all the fights that have happened and one is a list of all fighters that have participated in those fights. Since we are only interested in female fighters in this project, we will be carrying out a lot of data cleaning, which were illustrated in the fighter and fightstats notebooks. 

### Data analysis
After obtaining only the relevant information, the fighterEDA and fightstatsEDA notebooks focuses on analysis the data and identifying trends. 


### Challenges
There are a lot of technical terms being used in the dataset. especially in the list of all the fights that happened. It is defeinitely a steep learning curve, trying to figure out what those terms mean and how it fits in the data analysis portion of the project. 


### Future possibilities
There are still tons of directions we can go from here. For example, really dive into the weightclasses and see if there are differences between fighting strategies.
